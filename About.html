          Coronaviruses are a family of <a href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Antiviral_Drugs"target="blank"><B>Viruses</b></a> that cause illness such as
          vdiseases or gastrointestinal diseases.
          Respiratory diseases can range from the common cold to more severe diseases e,g.
          <ul type="circle">
            <li>Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV)</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/SARS_Severe_Acute_Respiratory_Syndrome"target="blank"><b>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV)</b></a>.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
       <p>
          A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been identified in humans previously.
          Once scientists determine exactly what coronavirus it is, they give it a name (as in the case of COVID-19, the virus causing it is SARS-CoV-2).       
       </p>
        <p>
          Coronaviruses got their name from the way that they look under a microscope.
          The virus consists of a core of genetic material surrounded by an envelope with protein spikes.
          This gives it the appearance of a crown. The word Corona means “crown” in Latin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coronaviruses are <a href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Zoonotic_Diseases"target="blank"> <b>Zoonotic</b> </a>, meaning that the viruses are transmitted between animals and humans.
          It has been determined that MERS-CoV was transmitted from dromedary camels to humans and SARS-CoV from civet cats to humans.
          The source of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is yet to be determined, but investigations are ongoing to identify the zoonotic source to the outbreak.

    <h2>Waves of Variants</h2>
      <p>
        Many variants of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus have arisen over the course of the pandemic. Some spread around the world, while others quickly faded away or were supplanted by other variants.
        <br>
        The Delta variant became dominant in the United States this summer, but Omicron has now surpassed it as the dominant variant, according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
