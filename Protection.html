        To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
          <li>Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</li>
          <li>Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</li>
          <li>Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
          <li>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li>
          <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
          <li>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.
        This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.

        <strong><mark><i>Masks</i></mark></strong>

        <br> 
        Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others.
        Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene.
        Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.
